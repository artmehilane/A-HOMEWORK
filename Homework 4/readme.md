### RSA authentication program
The goal is to create a command line-based program that allows generating RSA keys and
encrypt and decrypt text.
Program Features:
1. RSA key pair generation:
a. The program must be able to generate public and private keys.
b. The public and private key must be stored in some file. e.g. public_key.txt
2. Text encryption:
a. The program must enable encryption of the entered text (you can choose either
encrypt text from the command line or read from a file) using a private key.
b. The encrypted text must be saved in some file.
3. Text decryption:
a. The program must allow decryption using encrypted text
private key.
